4. Click the **Mobile Application** tile. 

    <!-- border -->![MDK](img-1.4.png)

5. Enter a name for your project, add a description (optional), and click **Create**. 

    <!-- border -->![MDK](img-1.5.png)
    
    >SAP Build Code recommends the dev space it deems most suitable, and it will automatically create a new one for you if you don't already have one. If you have other dev spaces of the Mobile Application type, you can select between them. If you want to create a different dev space, go to the Dev Space Manager. See [Working in the Dev Space Manager](https://help.sap.com/docs/build_code/d0d8f5bfc3d640478854e6f4e7c7584a/ad40d52d0bea4d79baaf9626509caf33.html).

6. Your project is being created in the Project table of the lobby. The creation of the project may take a few moments.

    <!-- border -->![MDK](img-1.6.png)

7. After you see a message stating that the project has been created successfully, click the project to open it. The project opens in SAP Business Application Studio, the SAP Build Code development environment.

    <!-- border -->![MDK](img-1.7.png)  

    >When you open the SAP Business Application Studio for the first time, a consent window may appear asking for permission to track your usage. Please review and provide your consent accordingly before proceeding.

### Configure the Project Using Storyboard

The Storyboard provides a graphical view of the application's runtime resources, external resources, UI of the application, and the connections between them. This allows for a quick understanding of the application's structure and components.

- **Runtime Resources**: In the Runtime Resources section, you can see the mobile services application and mobile destination used in the project, with a dotted-line connected to the External Resources.
- **External Resources**: In the External Resources section, you can see the external services used in the project, with a dotted-line connection to the Runtime Resource or the UI app.
- **UI Application**: In the UI Applications section, you can see the mobile applications.

1. Click on **+** button in the **Runtime Resources** column to add a mobile services app to your project. 

    <!-- border -->![MDK](img-2.1.png) 

    >This screen will only show up when your CF login session has expired. Use either `Credentials` OR  `SSO Passcode` option for authentication. After successful signed in to Cloud Foundry, select your Cloud Foundry Organization and Space where you have set up the initial configuration for your MDK app and click Apply.

    >![MDK](img-2.2.png) 

2. Choose `myapp.mdk.demo` from the applications list in the **Mobile Application Services** editor.

    <!-- border -->![MDK](img-2.3.png)  

3. Select `SampleServiceV4` from the destinations list and click **Add App to Project**.

    <!-- border -->![MDK](img-2.4.png)  

    >You can access the mobile services admin UI by clicking on the Mobile Services option on the right hand side.

    In the storyboard window, the app and mobile destination will be added under the Runtime Resources column. The mobile destination will also be added under the External Resources with a dotted-line connection to the Runtime Resource. The External Resource will be used to create the UI application.

    <!-- border -->![MDK](img-2.5.png)      

4. Click the **+** button in the UI application column header to add mobile UI for your project.

    <!-- border -->![MDK](img-2.6.png)     

5. In the **Basic Information** step, select the **MDK Template Type** as **Base**, leave the other options as they are, and click **Next**.

    <!-- border -->![MDK](img-2.7.png)  

    >The `Base` template creates the offline or online actions, rules, messages and an empty page (`Main.page`). After using this template, you can focus on creating your pages, other actions, and rules needed for your application. More details on _MDK template_ is available in [help documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/getting-started/mdk/bas.html#creating-a-new-project-cloud-foundry).

6. In the **Data Collections** step, provide the below information and click **Finish**:

    | Field | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Enter a path to service (e.g. /sap/opu/odata/sap/SERVICE_NAME)` | Leave it as it is  |
    | `Enable Offline` | It's enabled by default |
    | `Select all data collections` | Leave it as it is |
    | `What types of data will your application contain?` | Select `Customers`, `Products`, `SalesOrderHeaders` and `SalesOrderItems` |

    <!-- border -->![MDK](img-2.8.png) 

    Regardless of whether you are creating an online or offline application, this step is needed for app to connect to an OData service. When building an MDK Mobile application, it assumes the OData service created and the destination that points to this service is set up in Mobile Services. For MDK Web application, destination is set up in SAP BTP cockpit.

    >Since you have Enable Offline set to *Yes*, the generated application will be offline enabled in the MDK Mobile client and will run as online in Web environment.

    >Data Collections step retrieves the entity sets information for the selected destination.

7. After clicking **Finish**, the storyboard is updated displaying the UI component. The MDK project is generated in the project explorer based on your selections.

### Get familiar with generated project structure

This is how the project structure looks like within the workspace.

![MDK](img-3.1.png)

These are the [metadata definitions](https://help.sap.com/doc/69c2ce3e50454264acf9cafe6c6e442c/Latest/en-US/docs-en/reference/schemadoc/App.schema.html) available in the editor and the format in which these metadata definitions are stored in the editor. Just to brief on some of these:

- **`InitializeOffline.action`**: For Mobile applications, this action binds the application to the Mobile Services Offline OData server and downloads the required data from the `SampleServiceV4` to the offline store on the mobile device. For Web applications, it will initialize the `SampleServiceV4` service to be consumed in online mode.

- **`DownloadOffline.action`** and **`UploadOffline.action`**: These actions are applicable to Mobile client only. Using Mobile app initialization, data is downloaded to the offline store. If you want to have the application download any updated data from the backend server or upload changed data to the backend server (`SampleServiceV4`), these actions will be needed.

- **`Success & Failure Message action`**: Here are some messages showing up in the app on a successful or failure of data initialization, sync etc.

- **`Main.page`**: This is the first page of your MDK application that is shown. For this application you will use this as a launching page to get to application functionality.

- **`OnWillUpdate.js`**: This rule is applicable to Mobile client only. MDK applications automatically download updates and apply them to the client without the end-user needing to take any action. The `OnWillUpdate` rule empowers the user to run business logic before the new definitions are applied. This allows the app designer to include logic to prompt the user to accept or defer applying the new definitions based on their current activity. For example, if the end-user is currently adding new customer details or in the middle of a transaction, they will be able to defer the update. The app will prompt again the next time it checks for updates.

- **`Web`**: In this folder, you can provide web specific app resource files and configurations.

- **`Application.app`**: this is the main configuration file for your application from within SAP Business Application Studio. Here you define your start page (here in this tutorial, it is main.page), action settings for different stages of the application session lifecycle, push notifications, and more.

### Deploy the application

So far, you have learned how to quickly build an MDK application in the SAP Business Application Studio editor. Now, you will deploy the application definitions to Mobile Services and Cloud Foundry to use it in the Mobile client and Web application respectively.

1. Right-click `Application.app` and select **MDK: Deploy**.

    ![MDK](img-4.1.png)

2. Select deploy target as **Mobile & Cloud**.

   MDK editor will deploy the metadata to Mobile Services (for Mobile application) followed by to Cloud Foundry (for Web application). 
   
   - For Mobile Services deployment, choose Yes or No if you want to enable source for debugging the deployed bundle.
   - For Cloud Foundry deployment, enter application ID, application version and select web runtime deployment option.

   ![MDK](img-4.2.gif)

>First web deployment takes 2-3 minutes as it creates five service instances for the application. You can find the details of these instances in the space cockpit.

>-	XSUAA

>- destination

>- connectivity

>- HTML Repo host

>- HTML repo runtime

Ensure that you see successful messages for both deployments.
